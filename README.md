# Alcatel HH40v Router SMS Automation

## Alcatel HH40v Router

This project provides a solution to automate the process of sending SMS messages to the carrier using the API of the Alcatel HH40v Router. The purpose is to request additional data when the current data limit is reached, in order to maintain an uninterrupted and unlimited internet connection.

# Background
The Alcatel HH40v Router, is equipped with a SIM card slot for using 4G data. However, some carriers do not offer real unlimited data, requiring the user to send an SMS to the carrier to request additional data once the limit is reached. This manual process can be cumbersome, especially when the user requires uninterrupted internet access.

To simplify this process, this project automates the SMS sending procedure by leveraging the Alcatel HH40v Router API. It monitors incoming SMS messages and automatically sends an SMS to the carrier when a message indicating data depletion is received. This ensures a seamless and uninterrupted internet connection without manual intervention.
